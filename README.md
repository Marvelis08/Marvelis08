## About Me

I was born on August 29th 2008 and am from the United Kingdom.

I'm interested in computer science, artificial intelligence, and image manipulation. I also love maps, flags and history.
I like music from decades before I was born. My favorite bands are probably Kino, The Smiths, Echo and the Bunnymen, and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

I am currently a sixth-form student.
